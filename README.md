# **Zero to Developer: Fast, Cheap, and Effective**

So you want to work as a software engineer? There's no doubt there's a LOT to cover to go from zero to being able to work successfully as a software engineer. You need to be familiar with certain tools that help you read, write, and release code, you need to have strong attention to detail, you need to be able to read other people's code, you need to be able to take fundamental code building blocks and tools and use them to build software solutions, the list goes on. 

However, all you really need are two fundamental skills.

## Fundamental skills

**Know how to write code**

You need to know how to break down a solution into line-by-line code. Modern software is made of many, MANY lines of code. One line of code usually only does a very small action towards a whole task, so being able to think algorithmically (take a big problem and break it into tiny pieces) is incredibly important. 

It's not necessary to memorize exactly how code is written, but it's crucial that you can decide, for example, "okay, I need to write a for loop here". If you forget exactly how code is written in a particular programming language, you can just look it up.

**Know how to read and understand code**

Believe it or not, only a small portion of your time working as a software engineer will be used to write code. Instead, you'll spend the majority of your time reading code, either from the code you're working on or examples online. Again, you have to break down the code into its individual lines and see how they all fit together to solve the problems. 

When you join a company as a software engineer, it's unlikely you'll have to build an application from scratch. It will help immensely to build some software applications for your portfolio (which I will cover later), but more than likely, when you start work at a job, you will have to maintain and build out code on an existing application. That will require you to figure out how the existing code works. You don't necessarily have to understand every single line of code in the application, but you do need to know enough about what the code is doing and why the people who wrote it did what they did so you can interact with it. Once you understand how other people's code works, you can begin to contribute successfully to the codebase.

## What you need and what you don't need
You don't need: 
* A degree in IT or computer science
* A brand new expensive computer
* Expensive tools
* A coding bootcamp that costs anywhere between $15k and $40k USD
* Knowledge of calculus or even algebra in most cases

You can begin learning for your software career with as little as $0, as long as you have a computer with Internet connection.

**You are not required to spend money on learning how to code.** I cannot stress this point enough. A coding bootcamp *can* help you get working faster, but it often doesn't help as much as you'd think.

It's also a smart idea to avoid those "flexible" or "part-time" coding bootcamps too. In my experience, you spend several thousands of dollars to mostly teach yourself the concepts. You do get *some* mentorship and guidance, but nowhere near enough to justify the price. 

In addition, those "flexible" programs tend not to be as flexible as they pretend to be. When you reach the end of the timeframe they give you and almost certainly don't meet their strict timelines for when you "should" know something, they cut off your access before you're ready and then you're right back to teaching yourself.

You can use a little bit of money as a lubricant for your learning. Paid courses on Udemy or Pluralsight ($10-$50/course or $30/month respectively) are fantastic.  

However, you will need:
* A working computer and Internet connection
* A curious attitude
* An attention to detail
* Guidance on what you actually need to learn
* The ability to keep yourself together when things inevitably don't go the way you expect or hope 

## What to study

The quickest and easiest way for you to move into a software development job is to study **web development**. If you decide you want to build other types of software, such as desktop/mobile applications or embedded systems, those will take much longer to learn and understand. If you really want to do those things, don't let us discourage you. Just understand that those will take more time and patience.

To simplify, web development is really just building websites. Websites have tons of code and tooling too. 

The individual components on the webpage are written with a tool called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). The appearance of those components are described using a tool called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). The interactivity of a webpage (for example, making something happen when you click on a button) is written with the JavaScript programming language. Note that HTML and CSS are not programming languages.

## Specific learning material

The best online resource to help you learn how to build websites and write code from scratch is (arguably) [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). They have all sorts of courses that can teach you the most basic ideas, as well as advanced topics such as machine learning (which requires not only code but lots of math).

At the time of this writing, there are four courses that will teach you most of what you need to know to begin working as a web developer. 

**Study these in order:**
1. [Responsive web design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design)

This course will teach you HTML and CSS. You will be able to build pretty websites using modern practices and tools. You won't really be able to interact with them much from these alone, but you can at least very quickly see the webpage elements and styles come to life in your web browser.

2. [JavaScript basics](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

Don't let the name of the course scare you. This will just teach you the basics of the JavaScript programming language and how to use those fundamental ideas to write real code that can solve real problems. This course doesn't really go over how to put that JavaScript into your webpage to make it interactive, but it will teach you a lot about how to work with code generally.

3. [Front-end development libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

Front-end refers to everything you see and interact with directly on a website. Nearly every modern website uses front-end frameworks (or development libraries) to scaffold more robust functionality and provide for faster application development. This is the part where you learn how to apply your JavaScript knowledge to building webpage interactivity. You will also use your combined knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to utilize the power of front-end frameworks.

4. [Back-end development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/)

Most websites interact with outside services to accomplish tasks. These services that you don't directly interact with on your webpage can broadly be called a back-end.

For example, when you login to a website, the webpage sends your login information to some service outside of the webpage. That service will figure out if you are who you say you are behind the scenes, and then tell the webpage "yes, this information is correct, let them in". From there, the webpage will show you information you can only see when you're logged in.

This course will teach you how to build and interact with back-end services so that you can build a full web application from all aspects.

### The value of these courses

There is a TON of material in those courses, and it will take at least a few months to get through all of that information. However, once you understand the concepts in the courses above, you actually know most of what you'll need to perform at your first web development job. If it turns out you need to learn other programming languages for your new job, since you're already familiar with JavaScript, that will help you get a hang of most other programming languages much quicker since a lot of the concepts transfer.

## Building a portfolio

A portfolio is essentially a set of coding projects or web applications you will use to demonstrate your knowledge of coding. 

You will need to show the world that you can write code. To start, you can simply brainstorm some ideas for applications you can build (or look up tutorials to inspire you) and start making the web applications.

You only really need two or three GOOD portfolio projects. If your projects utilize most of the skills taught in the four courses above, that should be sufficient to show prospective employers that you can develop web applications at least at a junior level, which is all you really need to start.

Once you have code written for these projects, you're going to want to make them available online. There are some quick, simple ways to **deploy** web applications, which basically just means to make them available and usable on the Internet. If you have an actual web application that you've written usable on the Internet, it will be very easy during the application and interview process to suggest to prospective employers to try out your website to see what you can do.

## Applying to jobs 
You need to reach out to humans to get noticed as a prospective software engineer (add recruiters on LinkedIn, go to local developer events).

## Interviewing

Finally, to get hired as a software engineer, you will need to learn how to handle coding interviews. A good resume and a good portfolio will get you an interview, but you need to learn how to pass an interview.

Here are some resources to help you do that:
1. [FreeCodeCamp's coding interview prep](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/)

You only need to complete the Data Structures and Algorithms sections. The remaining tasks are just activities for you to practice those skills.Work through some of them, but don't get hung up on completing every single challenge.

2. [The book **Cracking The Coding Interview**](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com)

Cracking the Coding Interview has its coding problems and solutions written in the Java programming language (which is actually quite a bit different from Javascript despite its name). However, a lot of the concepts you learned in Javascript will be transferrable.

## Additional skills

There are a few other skills you MIGHT want to help you get hired:
* Deploying code (making it available on the internet for people to use)
* Testing code (writing code that tests the code your users use so that you have an automated, repeatable, fast way to check that your code is doing the right things and not doing the wrong things)
* Architecting software (you don't have to worry about this if you're starting as an employee elsewhere, they don't make junior developers do this)

Again, you are very likely to have to interact with other people's code and modify it, instead of building applications from scratch. 

One free way to learn how to do this is to look for open-source projects (code projects where all the code is online and you can see it) and download them, read through them, and come up with ways to improve that code. I will get more into this later, you first need to understand how code is written so you can then learn how to read it.

There are also great tools that will help you write and navigate code better. Download and install these ASAP:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [User guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
* [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/download)
    * [User guide](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

## Peripheral roles

If you're having trouble getting hired as a software engineer, here are some roles you can try to land to kinda wiggle your way into writing application code:

**Software development engineer in test (SDET, also called quality engineer QE, or automation tester)**

As an SDET, your job is basically to write code that tests the code your users interact with. This title allows you to get away with having less technical skill than a software developer will need to write the code users actually use.

**BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GET PIGEONHOLED.** Technically, an SDET should be able to write application code as well as write code that runs tests. However, many companies treat SDETs as more junior or less skilled, and they may give your role too narrow of a definition for you to work on the actual code users use. If you land an SDET role, unless you want to keep working as one, do as much as you can to get your hands on application code. 

## Conclusion

Good luck! I believe in you. It's so so rewarding to be able to build software, and it provides you with so much career and lifestyle flexibility.
