# Glossary
**Acceptance test**: An automated test that essentially ensures that your code fulfills the business requirements of the task(s) you needed to complete.

**API**: stands for Application Programming Interface. In most cases, this refers to a set of HTTP endpoints through which your code can interact with another application. 

**Application**: the software program (or set of software programs) that you work on; also referred to here as "code" or "app"

**Application developer**: someone who builds software; interchangeable with "software engineer", "programmer", "coder" or "software developer"

**Automated test**: A method of code that executes somewhere in the software pipeline that tests a specific piece of the application without human intervention.  

**Behavioral interview**: A software engineering interview in which you are asked about your experience, disposition, and situational behavior.

**Career changer**: someone who finished schooling and did a job other than coding for a substantial amount of time before beginning learning how to code

**CI/CD**: Short for continuous integration/continuous deploy. Continuous integration means to go from committing your code to building it (i.e. compiling the code if the project's language is compiled, or putting all the necessary files and libraries together if the project's language is interpreted, then after that step running unit tests, security scans, etc.). Continuous deploy means for that build (the result of the aforementioned tasks) to be deployed to whichever environment is necessary.

**Clean code**: in summary, code that is easy to read, change, and build upon as needed

**Co-op**: A work experience that takes place over the course of a traditional school semester as well as into the summer/out of the summer. It's different from an internship in that an internship generally only lasts about three months (give or take). 

**Codebase**: the set of code and configuration files that make up the software application

**Coding bootcamp**: A X-week educational program that promises to take an individual from knowing very little about software development to being equipped to work as a junior software developer. 

**Cultural fit**: This is partially a buzzword, but partially also how well you can get along with your teammates and the ideology of the company, which may sound like a bunch of hogwash, but it's really meaningful. If you can't get along, you will NOT succeed. 

**Deploy**: The act of releasing your application, turning it from a codebase into something that end users can access.

**Framework**: a tool that provides you with templates and functionality that you can use to build software much faster than if you wrote all of the code from scratch

**Hackathon**: A competition in which software developers get together and create some sort of software application to solve a problem. These events usually take place over a weekend, and there are generally prizes for top competitors and recruiters looking to hire these students who are spending their free time writing more code. 

**Internship**: A work opportunity in which a college student (or recent graduate) can spend a few months working as a junior-level employee at a company, usually during the summer. Generally, coding bootcamp students are not eligible for most internships, since they usually require a four-year computer science or related degree. 

**Networking (computing)**: This refers to the interfacing of multiple devices and resources so that they can share data. 

**Networking (interpersonal)**: This refers to idea of meeting people, usually within your industry or your career sphere, so that you can share ideas, make friends, an. 

**OOP**: Short for object oriented programming. This is a programming language paradigm in which programmers define classes of code called objects, which contain attributes about something and functions that something can perform. 

**Production support**: The act of being there to identify and resolve any issues with your application when it's running live and providing service to its customers. If customers have an issue with the application itself (different from when a customer doesn't understand something about the app), depending on the severity of the issue, you may immediately need to spring into action and resolve the issue, no matter what time of day it is. 

**SDE**: Acronym for software development engineer; an individual with this job role is (on paper) primarily responsible for writing production code and building the software that ultimately ends up in the hands of the end user. 

**SDET**: Acronym for software development engineer in test; an individual with this job role is (on paper) primarily responsible for writing automated acceptance tests. 

**Staffing agency**: A company that recruits you to work at a separate company. For example, you work with ABC Recruiting to get you a position at JP Morgan Chase. In this example, you generally work as an employee of ABC Recruiting, contracted out to JP Morgan Chase. 

**Technical interview**: A software engineering interview in which you are asked coding questions. These kinds of questions usually require a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms. 

**Unit test**: An automated test for testing a specific input (scenario) for a single method or a single isolated unit of code. 

**Workshop**: An event that spans at least several house for which the goal is specifically to learn some skill, usually to get you started on a certain toolset or development technique. These events can often be expensive to attend, but since March 2020, it is easier than ever to find free or cheap virtual workshops.
