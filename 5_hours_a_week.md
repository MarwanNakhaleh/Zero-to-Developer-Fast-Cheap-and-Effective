# Zero to code pace for 5 hours a week
Understand that if you're dedicating less than twenty or so hours a week, it will take you a WHILE to learn enough to start working as a software engineer. 

Also understand that **this pacing is a work in progress**. If you find that five hours a week is too much time or too little time to do the work required, feel free to do more or less up to that five hour mark. Please let us know and we will look at adjusting the pace below to provide the most accurate roadmap we can.

You will be completing exercises and tutorials as well as going through articles that explain the ideas behind the exercises and tutorials.

## How to go through these exercises
You don't necessarily have to read the articles before doing the exercises if you feel like you learn better doing the exercises and then reading the articles. The exercises get you used to the actions and the actual things you write as a software developer, and the articles help you wrap your head around the larger concepts. 

Remember, it's not important for you to memorize how exactly to write code. It's far more important for you to know when you need to write certain code and in which order.
