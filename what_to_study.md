# What should I study?
*This guide assumes you are looking to get a job as quickly as possible, which generally means you will want to study web development. If you are not interested in working in web dev, this guide does not apply to you.*

## Learning the code
Go to [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/learn) and check out the certifications offered. FreeCodeCamp's certifications are composed of several courses each. For each certification track that offers material you'll need to know, read below to see which courses in each certification teach skills that are actually necessary or helpful to have in your job search.

You don't need to worry about actually earning these certification as much as you need to learn about the concepts. The certifications are not official and by themselves, they will not make or break your ability to get a job.

Below, certification names are headers. Necessary ones are bold. Not all courses inside each certification will be necessary.

If you see a certification on FreeCodeCamp that I don't have listed here, that means it's not necessary for you to know that material before you get your first job.

Also bear in mind that these courses alone, with no other knowledge, is **not sufficient** to enable you to get a web developer job.

### Key 
* **bold** = necessary
* *italic* = nice to have

If there are caveats to the suggestions, you will see them as sub-bullets under the course names.

Not everything from FreeCodeCamp is listed here, only the information that will help you get your first web developer job is listed.

### **Responsive web design certification**

* **Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App**
* **Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu**
* **Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers**
* **Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form**

* **Survey Form (project)**

* **Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting**
* **Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery**
* *Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label*
* *Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz*

* **Tribute Page (project)**

* **Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors By Building A Balance Sheet**
* **Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano**
* **Technical Documentation Page (project)**

* **Learn CSS Grid by Building a Magazine**
* **Product Landing Page (project)**

* **Personal Portfolio Webpage (project)**
    * I must stress that a portfolio will be key to getting you noticed by recruiters for web developer positions as someone without official credentials.

### **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**
* **Basic JavaScript**
* **ES6**
* *Regular Expressions* 
    * You'll need to know a little bit about this on the job, but likely not that much.
* **Debugging**
* **Basic Data Structures**
* **Basic Algorithm Scripting**
* **Object Oriented Programming**
* **Functional Programming**
* **Intermediate Algorithm Scripting**
* **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects**

### **Front End Development Libraries Certification**
* **Bootstrap** 
    * You may not actually end up using Bootstrap specifically on the job; you may end up using a similar library like Bulma or Tailwind.
    * Nonetheless, it's important to know how to use CSS libraries.
* *jQuery*
    * These days, jQuery is used less and less in modern web development, but it might help.
* **React**
* **Redux**
* **React and Redux**
* **Front end development libraries projects**
    * Some of these expect you to use jQuery and SASS; if a project expects you to use those and you didn't take those courses, either skip the project or do it in a way that doesn't bother with those tools.

### **Back End Development and APIs Certification**
* **Managing Packages with NPM**
* **Basic Node and Express**
* *MongoDB and Mongoose*
* **Back End Development and APIs Projects**
    * These projects will require you to know some database stuff, but the database you interact with may vary.

### *Quality Assurance Certification*
You won't be expected to know much about quality assurance as a junior developer. However, there is an expectation that you can at least check somehow that your code behaves as intended. 

If you have too much difficulty landing a software engineer job, getting a software testing job might be an easier way into your first role in the software industry.

* **Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai**
    * I marked Quality Assurance the certification track as "nice to have", but if you do explore QA, you WILL want to go through this course within the certification.
* *Advanced Node and Express*
* *Quality Assurance Projects*

### **Coding Interview Prep**
* **Algorithms**
* **Data Structures**
* **Take Home Projects**

## Necessary developer tools
FreeCodeCamp will do a great job of teaching you the *concepts* you need to know, but when you're writing real code, you're going to use a desktop application called an integrated development (IDE), along with several other tools to turn the code on your computer into a live web application.

You will need to know how to use and navigate the following tools:

### **Visual Studio Code**

Visual Studio Code (or as the cool kids call it, VSCode) is one of the most popular IDEs for web development. It comes out of the box with everything you need to right code and allows for all sorts of plugins that can supercharge your productivity.

Keep in mind that when you get to your first job, you *might* actually not end up using this specific IDE. However, you will very likely have to use a similar tool, and most of the same basic principles will apply.

* [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
* [Code editing](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/codeediting)
* [Productivity tips](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/productivity)
* [Personalize](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/configure)
* [Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/extend)
* [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/debugging)

### **Git (and GitHub)**
To summarize the difference between the two tools, **Git** is a software tool you install on your computer that helps you track who changed what code and when inside your code projects. **GitHub** is a website that allows you to host code repositories (projects) that are tracked by Git.

## Doing research
After completing everything above, you should have the knowledge to say "okay, to make X happen in my code, I need to do Y." As you inevitably encounter challenges where you have to figure something out on your own, you will need to be able research effectively.

Researching how to solve problems includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* Analyzing the code to see where something went wrong
* Using search engines to find solutions
* Reading documentation for a service you're using

### **Analyzing the code**
One of the central skills you need as a software engineer is the ability to break down what is happening in each line of code you read or write.

### **Using search engines**
Finding a solution online is often as simple as going to your search engine of choice and searching "how to do X." However, you need to be at a point where you can figure out what you're missing in your code.

## Building projects

Now that you have the technical skills to build full-stack applications (where you build both the front-end and back-end), you want to begin creating things.

You can follow t
