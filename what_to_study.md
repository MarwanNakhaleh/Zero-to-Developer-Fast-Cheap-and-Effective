*This guide assumes you are looking to get a job as quickly as possible, which generally means you will want to study web development. If you are not interested in working in web dev, this guide does not apply to you.*

Go to [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/learn) and check out the certifications offered. FreeCodeCamp's certifications are composed of several courses each. For each certification track that offers material you'll need to know, read below to see which courses in each certification teach skills that are actually necessary or helpful to have in your job search.

You don't need to worry about actually earning these certifications. They are not official and by themselves, they will not make or break your ability to get a job.

Certification names are headers. Necessary ones are bold. Not all courses inside each certification will be necessary.

Also bear in mind that these courses alone, with no other knowledge, is **not sufficient** to enable you to get a web developer job.

#### Key 
* **bold** = necessary
* *italic* = nice to have
* no style = unnecessary

Keep in mind that if a course is not marked in bold or italics, it doesn't mean you shouldn't bother with it. It just means you're not gonna need to know it to get a job. If there are caveats to the suggestions, you will see them as sub-bullets under the course names.
