# What should I study?
*This guide assumes you are looking to get a job as quickly as possible, which generally means you will want to study web development. If you are not interested in working in web dev, this guide does not apply to you.*

## FreeCodeCamp courses
Go to [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/learn) and check out the certifications offered. FreeCodeCamp's certifications are composed of several courses each. For each certification track that offers material you'll need to know, read below to see which courses in each certification teach skills that are actually necessary or helpful to have in your job search.

You don't need to worry about actually earning these certifications. They are not official and by themselves, they will not make or break your ability to get a job.

Certification names are headers. Necessary ones are bold. Not all courses inside each certification will be necessary.

If you see a certification on FreeCodeCamp that I don't have listed here, that means it's not necessary for you to know that material before you get your first job.

Also bear in mind that these courses alone, with no other knowledge, is **not sufficient** to enable you to get a web developer job.

### Key 
* **bold** = necessary
* *italic* = nice to have

If there are caveats to the suggestions, you will see them as sub-bullets under the course names.

Not everything from FreeCodeCamp is listed here, only the information that will help you get your first web developer job is listed.

### **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**

    * You'll need to know a little bit about this on the job, but likely not that much.

* **Functional Programming**
* **Intermediate Algorithm Scripting**

### **Front End Development Libraries Certification**
* **Bootstrap** 
    * You may not actually end up using bootstrap on the job; you may end up using a similar library like MaterialUI or Tailwind
    * Nonetheless, it's important to know how to use CSS libraries
* *jQuery*
    * These days, jQuery is used less and less in modern web development.
* **React**
* **Redux**
* **React and Redux**
* *Front end development libraries projects*
    * Some of these expect you to use jQuery and SASS; feel free to skip those and focus on the stuff that doesn't require you to use those.

### **Back End Development and APIs Certification**
* **Managing Packages with NPM**
* **Basic Node and Express**
* *MongoDB and Mongoose*
* **Back End Development and APIs Projects**
    * These projects will require you to know some database stuff, but the database you interact with may vary.

### *Quality Assurance Certification*

    * I marked Quality Assurance the certification track as "nice to have", but if you do explore QA, you WILL want to go through this course within the certification.

* *Quality Assurance Projects*

### **Coding Interview Prep**
* **Algorithms**
* **Data Structures**
* **Take Home Projects**
