# Before you begin your journey
When you decide you're ready to start learning to code, you will need to install the following tools on your computer:

* Visual Studio Code
* Git
* NPM and NodeJS

In addition, you will need to create accounts for the following services:

* GitHub
* FreeCodeCamp

## How to start
We rely strongly on FreeCodeCamp to teach the basic programming skills you need. However, the code you'll actually write as a software developer will reside on your computer, not in an education platform. Therefore, when you download and install VSCode and Git, you will be able to practice alongside the FreeCodeCamp material, but you will have real code on your computer that you can upload (or push) to GitHub.

NPM and NodeJS will allow you to run plain JavaScript code as files on your computer in your command line. This will be especially useful after you complete the HTML and CSS.
